This project focuses on building an AI-powered Text-to-Image Generator using Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art generative AI model. The system takes a natural language prompt as input and generates a high-quality image that visually represents the description.

The implementation is done using:

Hugging Face Diffusers → to load and run the Stable Diffusion model.

PyTorch → for GPU acceleration and efficient model computation.

Gradio (in Colab version) → to create an interactive web interface for user-friendly image generation.

Matplotlib → to display generated images within the notebook/script.
